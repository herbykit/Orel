# Orel

This project is a recreation of Kaigrealms, but not attached to a specific server.

It is still more like an Essentials Minecraft plugin as I noticed that most of the functions in the Essentials plugin I wouldn't need in the server I ran with friends.
We just needed a non-operator version of teleporting, setting homes, and a few other things.

### This is going to be the full list of commands available in this plugin, but it's not finished yet:
- tph username (teleport here)
- tpt username (teleport to)
- sethome homename
- delhome homename
- rnhome homename newhomename (rename a home)
